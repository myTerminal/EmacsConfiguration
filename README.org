The "replicable" heart of my personal workstations

** Init (Note for my future self)

Simply run the below on the new computer to be "adopted":

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/bin/bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myTerminal/dotfiles/master/bootstrap)"
#+END_EXAMPLE

OR the lazy version

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/bin/bash -c "$(curl https://gh.myterminal.me/setup)"
#+END_EXAMPLE

For macOS, the shell needs to be changed from Zsh to Bash and there needs to be a ~sudo xcode-select --install~ before anything else.

** Setup

Software setup for multiple operating platforms is included and it is performed if a known OS is detected.

To start the setup, run the following command in a terminal running bash: (provided [[https://github.com/myTerminal/forge][forge]] was fetched as a part of the init)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
( cd ~/.forge; ./start debug ~/.setup/forge-config.lisp )
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Software selection

** History

What started as [[https://github.com/myTerminal/dotfiles/tree/b384107562817ef181111c8c27bccaaa47614975][a home for my Emacs config]], [[https://github.com/myTerminal/dotfiles/tree/6bec073e40d7a1065b8c871f2158afb5b2a3debc][started to shift its shape]], soon turning into a comprehensive *dotfiles* project to host configuration for much more than just Emacs. The majority of it [[https://github.com/myTerminal/dotfiles/tree/v1.0.0][still mostly comprised of Emacs configuration]], so I eventually extracted it into [[https://github.com/myTerminal/.emacs.d][a separate project of its own]] to make things simple. I even pulled the setup scripts into their separate projects [[https://github.com/myTerminal/forge-legacy][here]] and then later [[https://github.com/myTerminal/forge][here]], but maintaining it was still tricky with its [[https://github.com/myTerminal/dotfiles/tree/v2.0.0][complex arrangement of configuration files for four operating platforms]] at once.

What you see now is an attempt to keep only what is relevant to my primary configuration across all my active workstations so that updates are less painful and effortless. There is more than one reason to keep scripts for macOS around, one of them is to use it on my work computers that barely align with my preferred setup, and the other is to continuously compare my "custom" setup with a fully-fledged family of macOS operating systems and fill in the gaps as I spot them.

There still is some inseparable residue related to other platforms that might eventually disappear, or otherwise bring in more complexity in the future.
